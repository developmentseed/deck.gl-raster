Welcome to the deck.gl-raster documentation! This blog will feature updates, tutorials, and tips for working with raster data in deck.gl.

## What is deck.gl-raster?

deck.gl-raster is a collection of packages that enable GPU-accelerated visualization of georeferenced raster data in [deck.gl](https://deck.gl). Whether you're working with Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs, Zarr arrays, or other raster formats, these packages provide efficient, scalable rendering.

## Live Demo

Here's a live COG layer rendering Sentinel-2 imagery:

<BrowserMap height="400px">
  <COGMap url="https://sentinel-cogs.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sentinel-s2-l2a-cogs/18/T/WL/2026/1/S2B_18TWL_20260101_0_L2A/TCI.tif" />
</BrowserMap>

## Interactive Example: Color Maps

One of the key features is the ability to apply color maps to your data. Here's an interactive demo of some available color maps:

<ColorMapDemo />

You can use these colormaps in your layers like this:

```typescript
import { COGLayer, colormapModule } from "@developmentseed/deck.gl-geotiff";

new COGLayer({
  id: "dem-layer",
  url: "https://example.com/dem.tif",
  modules: [colormapModule],
  moduleProps: {
    colormap: "viridis", // Try changing this!
    range: [0, 3000],
  },
});
```

## Key Features

- **Streaming**: Load only the data you need with COG and Zarr's chunk-based architecture
- **GPU Rendering**: Hardware-accelerated rendering for smooth performance
- **Reprojection**: Client-side reprojection for seamless integration with any map projection
- **Extensible**: Custom GPU modules for advanced rendering effects
